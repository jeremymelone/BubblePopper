# BubblePopper
Description:
A simple game made in a first year video game design class. Uses the program processing (https://www.processing.org/).

Instructions:
To play, select your difficulty by clicking one of the 3 difficulties on the title screen.

The objective is to cause all the bubbles on the screen to explode by clicking a limited number of times, which causes explosions which will pop the bubbles and cause chain reactions. 
Explosions with black borders mean that you earned an extra click, and explosions with white borders are extra large but don't last as long.
Have fun!
